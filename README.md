# About-me
This project is all about me with a guessing game.

## Feature Tasks

- [x] HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax. Look at examples online and in your textbook. Note that your JS must pass the rules in the linter that we installed.
- [x] Your JS file must contain a ‘use strict’ declaration at the top. Always.
- [x] Design a guessing game about you that involves FIVE yes/no questions. Be creative and fun and whimsical. Or not. It’s up to you! It’s your project!
The questions in the guessing game must require a mix of yes/no answers, and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses, with either .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() used to validate the user input and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.
- [x] Useful and descriptive console.log() messages in the JS are well written and correctly displaying to the browser console for each question of the guessing game.
Use CSS to style your page as you see fit, to the level of abilities in CSS that you currently have.
- [x] Follow the Add, Commit, Push process. It should be evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.
